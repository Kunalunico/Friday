Friday is an intelligent, voice-enabled AI chatbot system built to handle a wide range of tasks by acting as a digital agent. It doesn't just answer questions — it performs real-world actions across services like Slack, Gmail, Google Calendar, and Weather APIs. It also supports a conversational voice mode for hands-free interaction.

Friday isn't just a chatbot. It's a multi-service automation platform that uses LLMs and API orchestration to bridge the gap between user queries and real-world actions.
